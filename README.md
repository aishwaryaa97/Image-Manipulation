# Image-Manipulation

Smoothing and blurring is one of the most important preprocessing steps in all of computer vision and image processing. By smoothing an image prior to applying techniques such as edge detection or thresholding we are able to reduce the amount of high-frequency content, such as noise and edges (i.e., the “detail” of an image).

While this may sound counter-intuitive, by reducing the detail in an image we can more easily find objects that we are interested in.

Furthermore, this allows us to focus on the larger structural objects in the image.
